# ✈️ The Golden Runway Framework

![Status](https://img.shields.io/badge/Status-Draft_v1.2-orange) ![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-Open_Source-blue)

**The open-source standard for implementing a Supplemental Unemployment Benefit (SUB) plan, replacing layoffs with a Golden Runway.**

---

## 📖 Introduction
Layoffs are broken. The standard "Severance Package" (a lump sum payment and a door slam) is outdated, tax-inefficient, and psychologically damaging.

**The Golden Runway** is a proposed benefit framework designed to replace standard severance with active, long-term financial and career support. It operates on a simple premise: **If we hire you, we back you.**

### ⚡ The Shift

| The Old Way (Standard Severance) | The New Way (Golden Runway) |
| :--- | :--- |
| ❌ **Lump Sum Cash** (Taxed heavily) | ✅ **Salary Continuation** (Bi-weekly paycheck) |
| ❌ **"Door Slam"** (Immediate separation) | ✅ **"Soft Landing"** (Benefits & career support) |
| ❌ **Unfunded Liability** (Hits P&L instantly) | ✅ **Pre-Funded Trust** (Tax-advantaged asset) |

### 📈 The Business ROI (Employer Strategic Advantage)

| Standard Corporate Risk | The Aura Impact Strategy (Golden Runway) |
| :--- | :--- |
| ⚠️ **Innovation Stagnation**: Employees "play it safe" and avoid high-reward risks to protect their job security. | 🚀 **Innovation Warranty**: Guaranteed psychological safety allows your best talent to take the bold risks required for exponential growth. |
| ⚠️ **Talent Attrition**: High-performers are the first to leave during market volatility in search of "safer" competitors. | 🧲 **Talent Magnet**: Attracts elite, mission-driven performers who value an organization that backs its hiring with a social safety net. |
| ⚠️ **Total Business Collapse**: Sudden cash-flow failure or market shifts lead to immediate shutdown and loss of all human capital. | 🛡️ **Company Recovery Window**: The pre-funded Trust acts as a **business survival fund**, providing a 24-month window to pivot or recover while salaries continue to be paid. |

## 🚀 Key Concepts

### 1. The "Recruiting Warranty"
Coverage begins on **Day 1**. There is no vesting period. This signals to talent that the company is confident in its hiring decisions.

### 2. The Liability Shield (Governance)
The framework isn't just a benefit; it's a risk management tool.
* **Litigation Mitigation:** By offering extended runway, the plan acts as a pre-negotiated settlement against "front pay" lawsuits.
* **Fraud Prevention:** The **"State Peg"** mechanism ties eligibility to state unemployment audits, ensuring participants are actively looking for work.

### 3. The VEBA Trust Model
The framework recommends funding via a **Voluntary Employees' Beneficiary Association (VEBA)**.
* **Tax Efficiency:** Contributions are often tax-deductible; investment growth is tax-exempt.
* **Safety:** Assets in the Trust are protected from the Company's creditors.

> **🌍 International Note:**
> The Golden Runway framework is designed to scale across borders. While the specific funding vehicle changes by jurisdiction, the core promise (pre-funded security) remains constant.
>
> While "VEBA" is a specific US tax term, **Model A (Trust-Based Funding)** is a globally valid strategy.
> *For details on adapting this framework outside the US, please email [theauraimpact@gmail.com](mailto:theauraimpact@gmail.com).*

### 4. The "Contribution Holiday"
The plan aligns incentives. If retention is high and the Trust becomes overfunded (e.g., >125%), the Company gets a "premium holiday," effectively rewarding the organization for keeping its people.
