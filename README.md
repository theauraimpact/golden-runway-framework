**The open-source standard for implementing a Supplemental Unemployment Benefit (SUB) plan, replacing layoffs with a Golden Runway.**

---

## 📖 Introduction
Layoffs are broken. The standard "Severance Package" (a lump sum payment and a door slam) is outdated, tax-inefficient, and psychologically damaging.

**The Golden Runway** is a proposed benefit framework designed to replace standard severance with active, long-term financial and career support. It operates on a simple premise: **If we hire you, we back you.**

This repository contains the legal, financial, and administrative templates required to implement this benefit at your organization.

## 🚀 Key Concepts

### 1. The "Recruiting Warranty"
Coverage begins on **Day 1**. There is no vesting period. This signals to talent that the company is confident in its hiring decisions.

### 2. The VEBA Trust Model
The framework recommends funding via a **Voluntary Employees' Beneficiary Association (VEBA)**.
* **Tax Efficiency:** Contributions are often tax-deductible; investment growth is tax-exempt.
* **Safety:** Assets in the Trust are protected from the Company's creditors. If the company goes bankrupt, the severance money is safe.
> **🌍 International Note:**
> The Golden Runway framework is designed to scale across borders. While the specific funding vehicle changes by jurisdiction, the core promise (pre-funded security) remains constant.
> While "VEBA" is a specific US tax term, **Model A (Trust-Based Funding)** is a globally valid strategy.  
> *For details on adapting this framework outside the US, Send email to theauraimpact@gmail.com

### 3. The "Contribution Holiday"
The plan aligns incentives. If retention is high and the Trust becomes overfunded (e.g., >125%), the Company gets a "premium holiday," effectively rewarding the organization for keeping its people.
