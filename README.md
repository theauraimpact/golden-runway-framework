**The open-source standard for implementing a Supplemental Unemployment Benefit (SUB) plan, replacing layoffs with a Golden Runway.**

---

## 📖 Introduction
Layoffs are broken. The standard "Severance Package" (a lump sum payment and a door slam) is outdated, tax-inefficient, and psychologically damaging.

**The Golden Runway** is a proposed benefit framework designed to replace standard severance with active, long-term financial and career support. It operates on a simple premise: **If we hire you, we back you.**

### ⚡ The Shift

| The Old Way (Standard Severance) | The New Way (Golden Runway) |
| :--- | :--- |
| ❌ **Lump Sum Cash** (Taxed heavily) | ✅ **Salary Continuation** (Bi-weekly paycheck) |
| ❌ **"Door Slam"** (Immediate separation) | ✅ **"Soft Landing"** (Benefits & career support) |
| ❌ **Unfunded Liability** (Hits P&L instantly) | ✅ **Pre-Funded Trust** (Tax-advantaged asset) |

## 🚀 Key Concepts

### 1. The "Recruiting Warranty"
Coverage begins on **Day 1**. There is no vesting period. This signals to talent that the company is confident in its hiring decisions.

### 2. The VEBA Trust Model
The framework recommends funding via a **Voluntary Employees' Beneficiary Association (VEBA)**.
* **Tax Efficiency:** Contributions are often tax-deductible; investment growth is tax-exempt.
* **Safety:** Assets in the Trust are protected from the Company's creditors. If the company goes bankrupt, the severance money is safe.

> **🌍 International Note:**
> The Golden Runway framework is designed to scale across borders. While the specific funding vehicle changes by jurisdiction, the core promise (pre-funded security) remains constant.
>
> While "VEBA" is a specific US tax term, **Model A (Trust-Based Funding)** is a globally valid strategy.
> *For details on adapting this framework outside the US, please email [theauraimpact@gmail.com](mailto:theauraimpact@gmail.com).*

### 3. The "Contribution Holiday"
The plan aligns incentives. If retention is high and the Trust becomes overfunded (e.g., >125%), the Company gets a "premium holiday," effectively rewarding the organization for keeping its people.
